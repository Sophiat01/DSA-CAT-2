## Ignore Constants
-Constant factors are ignored.
e.g. 5n=O(n)
## Focus on the Dominant Term
- Only the term with the highest growth rate matters.
e.g. O(n3+n)=O(n3)
## Drop non-Dominant Terms
-For combined complexities, retain only the highest term.
e.g.O(n+n2+logn)â†’O(n2)
##   Multiplication for Nested Loops
-If loops depend on input size, their complexities multiply.
e.g.    for(i=0;i<n;i++) inside for
(j = 0; j < n; j++)for(j=0;j<n;j++): O(n^2).   
##    Constant Time Operations
- Operations like accessing an array element are O(1).
