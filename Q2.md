## Memory allocation
Arrays- Memory allocation is static. The size of an array must be defined during the time of declaration.
      -Memory is allocated continguously.
Linked Lists-Memory allocation is dynamic. Memory is allocated only when needed.
            -Each node is stored in a different location.

## Performance
Arrays- Performance is fast because it has fast access to elements(direct access) using an index.
      - Constant time O(1).
Linked Lists- Performance is slow because elements need to be transversed so thet they can be accessed.
            - Linear time O(n).

## Insertion and Deletion
Arrays- Insertion in the beginning or middle O(n). This is because elements need to be shifted to make space.
      - Insertion at the end O(1). If space is available.
      -Deletion at the beginning O(n). This is because elements need to be shifted to fill in space. 
Linked Lists- Insertion/Deletion in the beginning O(1).
            - Insertion/Deletion in the middle/end O(n). This is because tranversal is needed.
